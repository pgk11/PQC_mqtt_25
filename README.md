# PQC_mqtt_25
This project implements a post-quantum cryptographic key exchange between ESP32 and Raspberry Pi using NTRU and Kyber-768 algorithms over the MQTT protocol. It demonstrates secure IoT communication using python implementation in cryptographic libraries (liboqs) and real-time key encapsulation.
